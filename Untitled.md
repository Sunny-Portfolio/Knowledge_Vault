-How many car spots do you anticipate you will need? 1
- Will you be needing shed storage? Wouldn't mind it for extra storage or tires. - Can you provide your landlord contact information as a reference? - Lawn maintenance will be the tenant's responsibility. However, if the tenant does not wish to use the backyard, they are not required to maintain it but may become property of the lower unit. Would you like the backyard to be included? - Do you have tenant insurance? We have landlord insurance for the building in the event of any structural damages, however it does not cover tenant's personal belongings and any accidents you would be liable for. If you do, please send us the documentation for it. - There is no smoking of any kind in the unit (including weed and vapes). Is there any issue with this?
